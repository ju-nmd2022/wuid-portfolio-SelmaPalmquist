<h1> ABOUT ME </h1> 

<br>

<p> I am a 20 year old girl from Sweden and I am currently studying New Media Design 
    at Jönköping University. Since I began studying this program autumn 2022 I will 
    graduate in June 2025, after which I hope to continue with a creative profession. 
<br><br> 
    I have been painting and drawing on and off my whole life and have over the course 
    of my life made living room paintings for the Swedish SoMe-profile Filip Dikmen, 
    designed merch and am currently working on a poster for a small production movie. 
    Furthermore I work with commissions I receive from my instagram page
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/selma_drawingss/"> @selma_drawingss</a> 
    and, of course, paint for fun when I feel inspired. 
    <br><br>
    My drawing style mainly consists of realism (aiming for hyperrealism) and I often 
    include some sort of portrait. I feel comfortable drawing in any style though, and 
    have tried branching out to try something more expressive and abstract. Most often 
    I use pen on paper or draw digitally with my iPad and an Apple Pen. Lately I have 
    tried working with oil and acrylic paint/acrylic markers on canvas and have done a 
    few orders with these mediums as well. </p>
